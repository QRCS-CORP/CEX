       NOTE: Most of the tests in DIEHARD return a p-value, which               
       should be uniform on [0,1) if the input file contains truly              
       independent random bits.   Those p-values are obtained by                
       p=F(X), where F is the assumed distribution of the sample                
       random variable X---often normal. But that assumed F is just             
       an asymptotic approximation, for which the fit will be worst             
       in the tails. Thus you should not be surprised with                      
       occasional p-values near 0 or 1, such as .0012 or .9983.                 
       When a bit stream really FAILS BIG, you will get p's of 0 or             
       1 to six or more places.  By all means, do not, as a                     
       Statistician might, think that a p < .025 or p> .975 means               
       that the RNG has "failed the test at the .05 level".  Such               
       p's happen among the hundreds that DIEHARD produces, even                
       with good RNG's.  So keep in mind that " p happens".
